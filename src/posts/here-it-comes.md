From the US Airways mailing lists for frequent flyers (*emphasis* mine):

To ensure the safety and security of airline passengers, heightened security measures have been implemented at airports. As you plan your trip, please keep the following in mind:

* Be sure to **bring proper photo identification** before you leave home. Acceptable forms of identification are a valid photo driverâ€™s license, an active passport or an employee identification from a county, state or federal agency.
* Due to increased passenger and baggage security screenings at all airports, passengers should plan to arrive at the airport a **minimum of two hours** before departure for all domestic flights and minimum of two and a half hours for international flights.
* You may check your luggage at the ticket counter and at the E-Ticket Kiosks that US Airways operates at New York LaGuardia, Boston and Ronald Reagan Washington National airports. **Baggage will no longer be accepted for check in at curbside or at off-airport locations**. Luggage may be checked at the airport within four hours of flight time.
* Only customers holding an electronic ticket confirmation letter, a travel agency itinerary, a US Airways itinerary, boarding pass or a paper ticket will be permitted beyond the security check points. **People without tickets will not be permitted in the gate areas to greet arriving passengers or see off departing passengers.**
* Special arrangements will be made at the check-in counter to provide gate passes for parents or guardians of unaccompanied minors and passengers with special needs. Unaccompanied minors and passengers with special needs are required to go to the airport ticket counter to check-in.
* **Unauthorized, unattended vehicles near a terminal building will be towed**.
* There will be an **increased presence of law enforcement and security personnel** at airports, where there will also be **heightened vigilance for unattended bags**.
* **No knives of any size, or made from any material are permitted on flights**.
