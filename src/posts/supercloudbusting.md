Getting Informed
================

I’ve been deeply immersed in multicloud pursuits for 566 days[2](#footnote-2) and by gathering facts, I developed a few opinions. I now believe that in a few more years, multicloud becomes popularized, supercloud becomes revivified, and ubiquitous workload substrate becomes a reality.

First, let’s see where trends peaked as topics. For the trend of supercloud, we revisit the “Supercloud” related work out of Cornell circa 2015-2016.[3](#footnote-3)

> ***Supercloud** is an architecture that **taps the underlying services & primitives** **of hyperscale clouds** **to deliver additional value above and beyond** what's available from the public cloud provider. A supercloud delivers capabilities through software, consumed as services; **and can** run on a single hyperscale cloud or **span multiple clouds**.*[4](#footnote-4)

### Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen 🎶

At present, there are a few facts that come to mind on what is happening and what is going to happen.

* GCP is expanding region coverage to places like Dallas TX USA.[5](#footnote-5)
* Azure is expanding region coverage to places like Doha Qatar.[6](#footnote-6)
* AWS Local Zones and Outpost availability is expanding to places like Panama.[7](#footnote-7)
* 29% CAGR for public cloud revenue puts a path to ~$1T revenue in perspective.[8](#footnote-8)
* Companies like Observe build on Snowflake which builds on public clouds.[9](#footnote-9)
* And a contrarian point… 🤔 guy that shorted  has a new thesis.[10](#footnote-10)

Also, there are many places that are population centers and [where things are made](https://sunday.fudge.org/p/make-iiot-easy-on-yourself). So, supercloud could make sense for workloads that take advantage of access of eventual ubiquity and leverage the new digital highways (5G) being built as well.

Looking back, 20 years have passed since I last attended HP related technology conferences. But last week, I was fortunate to attend HPE Discover in the times of multicloud and supercloud almost 12+ years after I first wrote about ubiquitous workload substrate when I joined Acadia/VCE.

So, finally, please enjoy this [quick 60 second video clip from HPE Discover via theCube](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxuqz4mHpv77X7LEXAuKgoE8ppQyWiUJsU) where Dave Vellante’s supercloud meets Antonio Neri’s substrate! 

Place your bets!
