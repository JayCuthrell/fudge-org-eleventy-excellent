Enjoy!

 **Getting Informed**

My approach to bookmarking started with hand editing HTML files in the mid 1990s. Sadly, [link rot](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-a-decade-of-github-167088?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) has not been kind over the past +25 years.🤣

More recently, I’ve been trying to refine my [Zettlekasten](https://thefortunelabs.com/obsidian-note-taking-app/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) with Google Keep, Zapier, Slack, Matter, GitHub, and Obsidian while sunsetting my use of Evernote. So, I’d like to share just a few of my favorite links that have inspired me over the past year and helped inform issues of this newsletter.

[![Obsidian and the Zettelkasten Method](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/896e78b7-c04d-4451-a7f0-30fba72e84ce_600x338.jpeg "Obsidian and the Zettelkasten Method")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F896e78b7-c04d-4451-a7f0-30fba72e84ce_600x338.jpeg)**[Obsidian and the Zettelkasten Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=Etr_Wyfpyvk)**

 **One last thing...**

**Thank you for reading.**

Writing has been immensely rewarding for me.

Writing is the process by which you realize what you think and what you understand are two different things.
