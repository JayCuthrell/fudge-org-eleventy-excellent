 **Getting Informed**

You may recall that I use Twitter in an ephemeral way. I use Tweepy to *cleanup* after I get [my ideas tweeted](https://twitter.com/jaycuthrell?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) that might survive being added in an issue of [my newsletter](https://sunday.fudge.org?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and then (maybe one day) on [my blog](https://fudge.org?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

Sometimes I’m doing meta commentary on [@Techmeme](https://twitter.com/Techmeme?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). Sometimes my meta commentary gets picked up by [@TechmemeChatter](https://twitter.com/TechmemeChatter?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) when linked to on [techmeme.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=jaycuthrell%20site%3Atechmeme.com&utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) from [@jaycuthrell](https://www.google.com/search?q=jaycuthrell%20site%3Atechmeme.com&utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) even back in the olden times of my original [@qthrul](https://www.google.com/search?q=qthrul%20site%3Atechmeme.com&utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) handle.

Recently, Techmeme linked to coverage of chipmaker spend reaching $152B which is a +30% Y/Y increase. So, I looked back to 2011 supply chain for hard disk drives (HDD) and contrast this to the supply chain stories around semiconductors.

**[The $152B spend...](https://www.techmeme.com/211219/p7?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a211219p7)**

If [chipmakers are on track to spend $152B on semiconductor fabrication facilities and the means of production](https://www.techmeme.com/211219/p7?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a211219p7) it may mean we’re looking at 2017 era patterns. Arguably, we are very much on a path to being cheap as chips in 2022.

[www.techmeme.com](https://www.techmeme.com/211219/p7?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a211219p7)

My thinking at the time of this Techmeme coverage revolved around the idea that a pattern from 2011 might mean big things for 2022.

Flashback: In 2011, Thailand monsoon and rainfall flooding took lives, impacted lives, disrupted global manufacturing supply chains, and led to a year of hard disk drive shortages.  
  
Now: Pandemic.  
  
Soon: A "cheap as chips" future.📉

 **Addendum (Reader Feedback)**

Thanks for the rapid feedback from [Greg Meyer](https://gregmeyer.com?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) on my reasoning above.

Here’s how I answered Greg’s questions on my reasons:

*I see a few patterns in our modern demands…*

1. *Chips are going into everything that has a physical void to fill*
2. *Smart(er) devices is impacting wider numbers of supply chains*
3. *Chips with radios that can access multiple networking standards are increasingly common*

*I see a few historical patterns as well…*

1. *“Chip Dumping” and past press coverage of the 1980s i.e. [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/25/business/us-reaffirms-japan-chip-dumping.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/25/business/us-reaffirms-japan-chip-dumping.html?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)*
2. *“Copy Exactly” approaches becoming standardized across industry of the 1990s i.e. [https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/copy\_exactly](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/copy_exactly?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)!*
3. *“Tick Tock” becoming an ingrained culture of expectation for technology refreshes in the 2000s i.e. [https://www.extremetech.com/computing/127987-deliberate-excellence-why-intel-leads-the-world-in-semiconductor-manufacturing/](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/127987-deliberate-excellence-why-intel-leads-the-world-in-semiconductor-manufacturing/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)*
