Let’s take a look at ride-sharing in the city of sin and what is likely to be the future of getting around in just a few years.

 **Trending Down**

No matter what metric, the trends are all heading down for traditional taxi services in the Las Vegas area. From from the signage to the size of loading areas it was clear this week that transportation network companies (TNCs) were disrupting taxis at every turn.

Disruption will arrive in the form of a sedate sedan.

It was only a few years ago that lawsuits and threats were the last refuge of the taxi companies. Time and technology was not on the side of the taxis.

Just a few years ago, the primary coverage highlighted all the challenges and ignored the inevitable erosion of established market share.

During the early years of TNC arrival in Las Vegas, the only option for Uber pickup at the airport was as follows:

1. stand in line for the the rental car bus
2. take the bus to the rental car center
3. upon exiting the bus walk a block
4. cross the intersection to the gas station
5. summon an Uber (and hope)
6. hopefully find shade at the gas station while you wait

The battle for access to McCarran International Airport is now just a footnote in history.

The days of a complete geo location blocking screen for summoning an Uber is left to the history of those that saved screenshots.

 **Need a Lyft?**

The other interesting finding on this trip is just how dominant Lyft seems to have become in Las Vegas. Almost all my rides during the week were Lyft. In fact, if you want a referral code – For $15 in ride credit, download the Lyft app using my referral link: [https://www.lyft.com/ici/JAY34875](https://www.lyft.com/ici/JAY34875?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)
