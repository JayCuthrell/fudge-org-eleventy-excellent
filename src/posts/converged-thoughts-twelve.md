Parking Decks and Pricing Models
================================

Sometimes you see patterns. I see a few with regard to some of the software players that are often considered part of a past era in IT. Let‚Äôs take a look at Oracle and see where convergence will take us.

Great analogy.

Total coincidence. Right?

Anagrams are fun. Sometimes an anagram works on multiple levels. I‚Äôll play a bit of advocacy of a devious nature in a moment if you‚Äôll stay with me for a few more data points to consider.

Okay, technically there are more than just cores or users to content with but you get the gist‚Ä¶

Sometimes a new take on an old theme comes back into focus. Here, the folks at VMware are breathing new life into the oldie but goody of the Oracle Parking Deck.

That‚Äôs a very nice island.

===============

Now, before we get to the next part, I‚Äôd like to set aside time to praise a few elements of strategery on the part of Oracle. Stay with me here.

Still one of my favorite sessions ever at a Gartner event.

I blogged about the creation of an appliance by Oracle many many years ago and the impact it would have. It was the dawn of Exadata in 2008.

Convergence was upon us all in the IT world. My background in telecommunications also told me that there would very likely be a feisty time for many of the companies that had yet to be combined.

That‚Äôs what made Oracle interesting to watch. Their M&A teams would go out and just grab the companies that supported entire industry ecosystems.

Over the next 5 years since Exadata was announced a series of M&A events added to the history of Oracle. 2013 was an interesting year for Oracle and the M&A continued into 2016.

Imagine being in telecom (or a niche area of cloud services) and waking up one day to realize that one company has almost cornered the market on much of the software and hardware used to deliver a significant amount of your business critical infrastructure underpinning. Really. Oracle M&A has had quite a run.

What‚Äôs Next?
============

Convergence will continue. Where Converged Infrastructure (CI) as systems and Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI) as appliances and systems are found there will eventually come a new paradigm based on disaggregated infrastructure (DI) systems.

The shift to DI may come more at the expense of HCI systems than HCI appliances. DI systems will likely appear to be a variation of CI concepts but combined with HCI elements.

This is what makes pricing models for software so interesting. For the first time, the speed of how infrastructure and the systems that provide it will be moving very very fast.

Will a printed chart be required to understanding licensing implications of Enterprise software? Will there be software required to keep track of the licensing of the software? Is that completely illogical?

[![Will the licensing math become related to the number of page faults?](https://substack.com/static/4e2506023bbfbbeeb2d2db609769a91b/0a47e/page-faults.png "Will the licensing math become related to the number of page faults?")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fstatic%2F4e2506023bbfbbeeb2d2db609769a91b%2F0a47e%2Fpage-faults.png)Will the licensing math become related to the number of page faults?

Perhaps, when considering pricing models, it would be wise for any ISV or full stack company to avoid ‚Äúpunching your customer in the face‚Äù as Chad Sakac most recently reminded us all in the IT industry. Don‚Äôt be that kind of company, right?

[Disrupt Your Data Center with Transformative CI & HCI Technologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=wA7wt6IzpcE)

So, perhaps the growth in cloud initiatives and what appears to be increasingly complex software licensing schemes are related. Perhaps the goal of the ISV side of Oracle is to evolve into the very same cloud that was once openly tongue in cheek mocked by their leadership just one year after the Exadata was announced. Times change. Perhaps Oracle will to.

Convergence will be the assumption of a fully commensurate model of consumptive patterns that is fully beneficial to the customer and provider of technology. To achieve this modality, service pricing models, software pricing models, disaggregated infrastructure, and consumer grade commerce experiences will have to be placed into the same judicious amalgams that created everything from Exadata to Vblock to the humble but growing VxRail.

Convergence is the natural progression of how the IT industry will evolve to provide a truly commensurate model. Let‚Äôs see how 2017 rewards the companies that embrace and extend that vision to their customers.

Now‚Ä¶ does anyone remember where we parked?
