*[Duran Duran - Is There Something I Should Know? (1982)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M0hogZyRyU)*

Getting Informed
================

If you are new to OpenTelemetry — or “Otel” for short — that’s understandable. You might have come across application performance management companies, tools, techniques, or even projects like OpenTracing[1](#footnote-1) or OpenCensus[2](#footnote-2) that predate Otel.

-------------------------------------

During the .com years, it was common to find references to “load testing” or “traffic simulation” software and vendors in response to ever greater expectations for performance of so-called “3 tier” web applications. The common thinking then was that by instrumenting each tier and then simulating the growing consumer web traffic *before* you launched a website, you might find performance bottlenecks to fix leading to a better end user outcome — especially if there was a commercial component to the website such as e-commerce, etc. that relied upon performance layers for the web servers, app servers, and database servers.

Fast forward a few years and the IT analyst community identified a growing number of vendors supplying software performance agents, software performance collectors, and performance measurement oriented tools as the “application performance management” market. By 2013, application performance management had become a somewhat crowded[3](#footnote-3) multibillion dollar market that is currently[4](#footnote-4) on track to become better known as the “observability” market.

By 2015, The OpenTracing Project was launched by Uber application performance management engineers with the ambition of proving a vendor neutral instrumentation library for developers interested in application performance management. Similarly, Google application performance management engineers using similar internal tools became the inspiration for a clean room implementation of those tools called OpenCensus.

Maybe next year maybe no go 🎶
-----------------------------

By early 2019[5](#footnote-5), convergence took place as OpenTracing and OpenCensus merged to create OpenTelemetry[6](#footnote-6). So, if you are starting out with an understanding of Otel you can relegate references to OpenTracing as a historical foundational footnote that has been archived by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation[7](#footnote-7) as of early 2022.

Who uses Otel?

Well, first, let’s recall recent posts regarding platform engineering and [telemetry](https://www.google.com/search?q=telemetry+site%3Asunday.fudge.org).

Luckily, [Charity Majors](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charity-majors/), CTO of [Honeycomb.io](https://www.honeycomb.io) recently provided succinct examples[8](#footnote-8) across both Plaform Engineers and Site Reliability Engineers. 

Platform Engineers:


> *Builds for Internal developer teams*
> 
> *Uses APM, observability, tracing. Cares a lot about instrumentation and OpenTelemetry.*
> 
> 

Site Reliability Engineers:


> *Builds for customers*
> 
> *Uses metrics, logs, dashboards; monitoring, alerting, and agent/sidecar/blackbox telemetry.*
