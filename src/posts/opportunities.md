This week we take a look at recent funding, mergers, and acquisitions related to platform engineering.

# Getting Informed

Summer has arrived. This week, Fudge Sunday will be shorter than usual.

Buttondown has added [newsletter features](https://buttondown.email/changelog) I am testing. For example, my "Music" section will display a Spotify card from [Fudge Sunday playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ZALK6TiXvBVztITrrybkN?si=bfaea100e0374037) and a long running survey will at the end of each email.

Now let's look at a few recent funding, mergers, and acquisitions that relate to platform engineering.

## Ask yourself this question: Do you want to be rich ðŸŽ¶

Machine learning operations (MLOps) has just a few references[^MLOPs] in Fudge Sunday but it is reasonable to expect funding for MLOPs companies to increase in the coming years. So, congrats to the [Striveworks](https://www.techmeme.com/230613/p16#a230613p16) team on their new funding!

You might recall several companies referenced in [Do You Need the Service Catalog](https://fudge.org/archive/do-you-need-the-service-catalog/) will see more funding in the coming years. So, congrats to the [Cortex](https://www.techmeme.com/230531/p36#a230531p36) team on their recent round!

## I'm looking for a partner, regardless of expense ðŸŽ¶

Meanwhile, in addition to funding there have been a few mergers and acquisition activities â€” sometimes both. For now, I'll briefly discuss a couple.

First, platform engineering isn't limited to specific countries or regions â€” it is global. So, here's to a warm welcome to the [Agyla SAS](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7074719647400390656) team!

Second, platform engineering fuses multiple disciplines and technologies for the benefit of ongoing improvements in the developer experience. So, here is a double duty warm welcome to [NS1](https://www.techmeme.com/230413/p30#a230413p30) and hearty congrats to the [NetBox Labs](https://www.techmeme.com/230413/p30#a230413p30) team on their funding!

So, what will be the next big thing in funding, mergers, and acquisitions related to platform engineering?

Until thenâ€¦ Place your bets!
