*Cardio and diet make for a washboard abs villain.*

That’s right. Software is a villain that wants great abs.

You’ve probably heard various “eat” neologisms if you spend any amount of time on the Internet. That’s right! Things “eat” other things!

It’s zoomorphism anthropomorphism concatenation time!

*Software is hungry!*
=====================

Software is actually a Galactus-style entity that consumes entire planets. As such, the world is a great anytime snack that is literally packed with just about everything that a Marvel universe villain needs.

One example from our recent Western society / post .com / post microwave / on demand / immediate gratification era concerns how software will “eat” entire planets to sustain itself. Whoa. How exciting!

*Rise and shine!*

Or, perhaps you’re old enough to remember the 1980s and have heard the one about how culture will “eat” strategy after intermittent fasting. Summer approaches and it’s all about fitting into that corporate swimsuit!

Culture uses caloric restriction across time bounded intervals to promote fat loss and improve insulin resistance. Strategy is an essential part of a balanced ketogenic diet. Culture is already active enough to operate at a caloric deficit and will most likely have really great abs just in time for summer. Watch those macros!
