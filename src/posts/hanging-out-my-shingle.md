This week we take a look at how one door closes, Job Search Council, Raleigh-Durham Startup Week 2024, and what's next for me.

## Getting Informed

A lot happened this week. Let's dig into it.

### My time at IBM

First, last week was also my last week at IBM. My return to IBM was an amazing privilege. I am incredibly thankful for having the opportunity to make an impact with IBM's key acquisition companies, roadmaps, clients, and industry analysts. I salute my peers at IBM and the many IBM acquisition companies! ‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏èüìäü§ñüß†ü§ìüöÄ

As is customary, I sent a farewell email to a few of my work peers. However, what is likely to become more customary, is the use of Generative A.I. (GenAI) in the farewell email process.

> Help me write an executive level fawewell letter to my peers that I've worked with for the past 619 days.

Specifically, I used a [watsonx Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant/artificial-intelligence) to craft the rough layout of my farewell letter then added my personalized flourishes. I had my pick of models and compared [Granite](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X9W4O6BM) and [Llama](https://research.facebook.com/publications/llama-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models/). In the end, I went with the [Granite](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X9W4O6BM) options for edits because the [Llama](https://research.facebook.com/publications/llama-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models/) model results seemed too unprofessional (amusing perhaps but problematic at best) for my use case, my tastes, and my sensibilities. 

Truly, we are entering a brave new world.

Oh. What about other GenAI options? Well, my results varied widely.

- Anthropic Claude 3: Way too saccharine for my tastes ü§î
- OpenAI ChatGPT: Way too many words... and coming from me that's saying something ü§£
- Google Gemini: Way too many hallucinations about me and my reasons for leaving ü§∑

Granted, I could have likely tuned and attenuated the prompts for better results. However, I didn't want to turn a farewell letter into an extended prompt engineering exercise. [watsonx Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant/artificial-intelligence) and [Granite](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X9W4O6BM) got me to the 95% Goldilocks mark by capturing my sentiments accurately and succinctly.

BTW ‚Äî Fellow IBMers and IBM acquisition company peers ‚Äî If you didn't get my [Granite](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X9W4O6BM)-inspired farewell email and are reading this update: [Please stay in touch](https://jaycuthrell.com/contact)!

### Job Search Council

Second, I am proud to be part of a newly formed Job Search Council (JSC). A JSC is where [Never Search Alone](https://phyl.org) techniques are used within a mutual support group to find jobs that each of the group members will love.

I am honored to join my fellow JSC members on this journey. We are meeting weekly over the next 2-3 months where I commit to put in the 80+ hours required for this effort.

### High Energy Enthusiasm

Third, I was fortunate to attend [Raleigh-Durham Startup Week 2024](https://www.raleighdurhamstartupweek.com). The event was **free** to attend thanks to the generous support of the [sponsors and co-working spaces](https://www.raleighdurhamstartupweek.com/#get-involved). In total, there were several dozen sessions, 1,000+ attendees, and almost 100 speakers across 2 cities.

Of particular note, the event used a compelling mobile app from [Whova](https://whova.com) that I hope SXSW will consider for SXSW 2026. One of the cool features that [Whova](https://whova.com) offered was the ability to create, coordinate, and update attendee meetups. As a result, I was able to quickly create an ad hoc newsletter writer meetup with only a few clicks. ü§ì

### Hello World

Third, I am [hanging out my shingle](https://cuthrell.consulting) _again_. After soaking up some [Raleigh-Durham Startup Week 2024](https://www.raleighdurhamstartupweek.com) positive vibes energy and pulling a late evening website refresh, I shared a quick update on LinkedIn.

<iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7184396649664815104" height="301" width="504" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" title="Embedded post"></iframe>

Of course, now the real work begins. Right now, I'm using my ```cuthrell.com``` domain for Mastdon/Fediverse purposes. Eventually, I'll decide on any other shorthand .TLD variants but [cuthrell.consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting) will get the job done for now.

Initially, I'll be offering [very specific niche services](https://cuthrell.consulting/services/):

For startups and emerging technology companies

- Fractional strategic roles for product-led, community-led, channel-led, sales-led, and M&A-led growth
- Enterprise advisory services for pragmatic GenAI and data platforms

For Telco, Media, and Entertainment companies

- Fractional strategic roles for product-led and sales-led growth
- Convergence advisory services for pragmatic GenAI and data platforms

For Venture Capital and investment companies

- Fractional strategic roles at portfolio companies
- Diligence advisory services

Over my 25+ year career timeline, I've developed a niche expertise in concurrent nested mergers and acquisitions. As for why I believe that M&A is going to be a bigger story in 2024 than years prior... a few data points:

- This [quote post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_wiz-ceo-2024-will-be-the-year-of-acquisitions-activity-7182523881671282688-mGaO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on LinkedIn has almost 10,000 views. üìà
- This [quote post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaycuthrell_mas-bumpy-ride-activity-7178020320514080768-c0st?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on LinkedIn from McKinsey indicates crossing beyond the $1T M&A activity mark is likely. üìà

My theory is that acquisition-led growth companies in 2024 are going to need experts to come in with a neutral dispassionate approach to combine, align, and unify the roadmaps across multiple acquired companies during the integration process for value creation. And, I believe I am that expert to act as a catalyst to realize truly accretive acquisition outcomes.

At some point, I'll write about my _Many D's_ approach to M&A in a future Fudge Sunday edition. For now, I've put some of my favorite backronyms like [GLEEN](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-do-you-your-team-members-making-creative-contributions-jaqsc?contributionUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28articleSegment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AlinkedInArticle%3A7179905735231774720%2C7179905737035276288%29%2C7184664892816117760%29&trk=rtyc&utm_source=share&utm_campaign=copy_contribution_link&utm_medium=member_desktop&articleSegmentUrn=urn%3Ali%3AarticleSegment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AlinkedInArticle%3A7179905735231774720%2C7179905737035276288%29&dashContributionUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287184664892816117760%2CarticleSegment%3A%28urn%3Ali%3AlinkedInArticle%3A7179905735231774720%2C7179905737035276288%29%29) into the universe of content aggregation within LinkedIn.

Baby steps.

### What's Next

Finally, as for the emerging technologies that I want to align with for [cuthrell.consulting](https://cuthrell.consulting), I will be catching up on content from [VeloxCon](https://veloxcon.io) and digging into the [Comet roadmap](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion-comet) this week with findings presented in future Fudge Sunday newsletter updates. Look for a return to deeply technical topics.

Additionally, I plan to explore a few ideas around GenAI and Fudge Sunday newsletter. For example...you'll note that I add this to each page I've produced on ```fudge.org``` has an image and link in the footer:

[![Written by Human, Not by AI](/assets/images/Written-By-Human-Not-By-AI-Badge-white.svg)](https://notbyai.fyi/)

As a reminder, the words you are seeing in Fudge Sunday were created by me. However, the world of GenAI might have a place in my workflow going forward. A few weeks ago, [Marshall Kirkpatrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marshallkirkpatrick/) piqued my GenAI curiosity ü§î for how I could apply it to Fudge Sunday. Last week, [Elizabeth Quintanilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethquintanilla/) expanded my mind ü§Ø with her GenAI skills on Canva, Adobe, and more. So, stay tuned.

What's the probability that Fudge Sunday will become a GenAI summarized, podcasted, and vertical video published output in 2024?

Until then... place your bets.

p.s. As I've gotten older, I have come to appreciate getting snail mail. If you have time to [drop me a postcard](https://jaycuthrell.com/contact), I'm going to be scanning the picture side of the postcards I've received and linking to a Fudge Sunday Reader Postcards gallery (with suitable redactions and filtering for greater anonymity) as a newsletter trailer of sorts. Stay tuned! ‚úâÔ∏è
