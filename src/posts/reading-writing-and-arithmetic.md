Getting Informed
================

A few months ago, I decided to buy YouTube Premium and I have been mashing that Subscribe button ever since. This week I am sharing some of what I found worthy of an hour or two of attention each week.

Please subscribe for free to receive new posts!

People I know, places I go ðŸŽ¶
----------------------------

Initially, justifying payment to YouTube Premium was mostly to avoid the annoyance of advertising. However, I now realize the experience is far superior to paying a bill for whatever passes as cable TV or streaming entertainment these days.

[Christina Warren](https://twitter.com/film_girl) and the team at GitHub provide me with an idea of what I might have missed and what I need to maintain my tech situational awareness. After all, GitHub has a community of [~60M users](https://github.com/search?q=type:user&type=Users), so a lot goes on that anyone could miss. 

[Cassie Kozyrkov](https://twitter.com/quaesita) has put up [100+ episodes](https://www.youtube.com/c/Kozyrkov/videos?view=0&sort=da&flow=grid) of Making Friends with Machine Learning. While youâ€™ll probably need more than one cup (pot?) of coffee, there are +6 hours of learning about machine learning just a click away.

[Rawkode](https://twitter.com/rawkode) first caught my attention when I was watching Twitch.tv for Equinix Metal (Packet) related live coding hands on videos. There are 100+ hands on videos on a variety of open source cloud native topics posted on everything from k8s fundamentals to DevSpace.

[Stand-Up Maths](http://twitter.com/standupmaths) is a guilty pleasure. Primarily, this channel reminds me just how little I know about the deep end of the pool that is mathematics. 

[3Blue1Brown](https://twitter.com/3blue1brown) has a similar appeal. It too reminds me that I should stay in the shallow part of the pool that is mathematics. 

[DevAsLife](https://twitter.com/inkdrop_app) helps me understand the art of possible in developer experiences. Each video is a multidisciplinary example for the poetry of domain specific languages.

[Sreenivas Bhattiprolu](https://twitter.com/digitalsreeni) is the teacher I wish I had when I was studying materials science and engineering. By connecting practitioner essentials of coding, automation, and analysis thinking for real world applications, each episode offers a chance to grow professionally.

This has been just a few of the 50+ subscriptions I enjoy on YouTube Premium. Granted, I did consider a few more honorable mentions, but those will have to be in a future post.

Until next timeâ€¦ place your bets!
