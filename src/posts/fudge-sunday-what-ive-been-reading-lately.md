[![Start the week more informed](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a31a5f50-f536-4cf7-a9c4-880e83385316_1200x115.png "Start the week more informed")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa31a5f50-f536-4cf7-a9c4-880e83385316_1200x115.png)If you find yourself hitting refresh on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Hacker News or *\*shiver\** BuzzFeed then it might be time to subscribe to a few mailing lists and newsletters. This week, I am sharing articles linked in the mailing lists and newsletters I‚Äôve been reading lately.

 **Recommendation: Oh... M. G.**

**[On curation](https://500ish.com/cut-copy-paste-highlight-864baece0965?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)**

I‚Äôve been reading [M.G. Siegler](https://mgsiegler.com?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for well over a decade. A hallmark of his writing is command of coherent compelling narrative and publishing across [a](https://twitter.com/mgsiegler?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) [wide](https://500ish.com/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) [variety](https://5ish.org/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) [of](https://mgs.blog?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) [formats](https://reviewinhaiku.com/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

What *sorcery* is this? In fact, a recent short essay shares [some of his methods](https://500ish.com/cut-copy-paste-highlight-864baece0965?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and the likely potential for app sorcery that does not yet exist.

An expected part of reading M.G.‚Äòs writing is his knack for rapid pattern recognition but the delightful part is his eerily accurate prognostication. For example, consider this short essay on [the future of UI/UX reactions to content in July of 2015](https://500ish.com/simple-smile-thumbs-up-8865f5912d84?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) compared to findings 6 years later in [news coverage of UI/UX developments from May of 2021](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458959/twitter-reactions-feature-facebook-sad-cheer?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

 **Multicloud Rosetta Stone Reading**

As I‚Äôve discussed in my blog, [marketing is hard in the world of hyperscale cloud service providers](https://fudge.org/archive/multicloud-march?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). I‚Äôve subscribed to several newsletters that cover the cloud market but it‚Äôs difficult to recommend any in this issue but a few links did catch my eye even if they are more *multiple clouds* than *multicloud*.

**[Shaving cartridges of the clouds](https://towardsdatascience.com/datastore-choices-sql-vs-nosql-database-ebec24d56106?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)**

There are some great posts over at Medium these days but I tend to favor newsletters. One such post (in a newsletter) caught my attention that simplifies [how to think about similar datastore choices across multiple clouds](https://towardsdatascience.com/datastore-choices-sql-vs-nosql-database-ebec24d56106?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

The growth of sponsored posts is a testament to the way blogs have sought out different ways to make a living. This post from MinIO is well structured and compelling multiple clouds essay on [the rising popularity of object storage and overcoming a widening array of incompatible proprietary APIs](https://thenewstack.io/an-architects-guide-to-multicloud/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).¬†

Jamstack community trends posts can provide insights into the market perception of lowest friction alternatives in multiple clouds. A recent post from the always insightful [Lawrence Hecht](https://thenewstack.io/author/lawrence-hecht/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) considers [the stacked rank of where the Jamstack is landing year over year across multiple clouds](https://thenewstack.io/cdn-providers-rival-hyperscale-clouds-for-web-developers-deploying-jamstack/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

 **Posts that make the rounds**

Sometimes you‚Äôll see a post referenced in multiple newsletters.

a16z has become quite the content farm over the years in addition to their VC roots from podcasts to blogs to ClubHouse to self reinforcing references for all of the above.

‚úçÔ∏è @[a16z](https://twitter.com/a16z) built a precision earned media content farm over the years: blogs, essays, podcasts, newsletters, events, etc.

One last tweet for the road‚Ä¶

Eventually "the hot aisle" will become niche as changing heat exchange uses cases bring two-phase engineered fluid immersion cooling into wider adoption that are compounded by the progression of advanced RISC machines to edge / core / cloud modalities.
