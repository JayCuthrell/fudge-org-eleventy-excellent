## Hot Fudge Daily Digest

As promised, a seven ( 7 ) day roundup of [Hot Fudge Daily](https://hot.fudge.org) will be included in [Fudge Sunday](/) going forward until feedback arrives asking for it to be removed. I'll try to keep this compact. 🤓

### [🌶️ Spicy Edition Sunday](https://hot.fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday/)

Fudge Sunday readers have asked me about my writing process. So, I'm [sharing my writing process](https://hot.fudge.org/archive/spicy-edition-sunday/) each Sunday.

### [📈 Markets Monday](https://hot.fudge.org/archive/markets-monday/)

Generally, I will experiment on Monday with what I think might matter in the market. For example, on Monday we heard from Apple WWDC, and while not an explicitly investor-oriented event, it was fascinating to hear [what was said and what was not said](https://hot.fudge.org/archive/markets-monday/).

### [🔥 Hot Takes Tuesday](https://hot.fudge.org/archive/hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11/)

Big funding and M&A moves in tech - from cutting-edge language models to cybersecurity startups.

- [Cognizant acquires Belcan for $1.8B](https://www.techmeme.com/240610/p8?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240610p8) \- 💼 If you like your GSI to come with a strong ER&D to get jiggy wit IIoT then you are in luck.
- [AlphaSense acquired Tegus for $930M](https://www.techmeme.com/240611/p21?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240611p21) \- 🤖 If you are doing manual research methods the old fashioned way, hold on to your hat because it is going to be blowing full gale A.I. sooner than you might think.
- [Harvey and vLex combination potential](https://www.techmeme.com/240607/p20?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240607p20) \- ⚖️ What if legal advice meets the blowing full gale A.I. too?
- [Fortinet acquires Lacework](https://www.techmeme.com/240610/p36?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240610p36) \- 🔮 Seeing a combination of SASE, AIOps, and CNAPP is a pattern that will repeat.
- [Mistral raises $644M](https://www.techmeme.com/240611/p11?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240611p11) \- 🤖 Because those NVIDIA processors aren't on sale and when I asked Mistral AI what it was it said: *Mistral AI is a cutting-edge language model developer.*
- [Cognigy raises $100M](https://www.techmeme.com/240611/p18?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240611p18) \- 🤖 Because in the future, when you are on hold and say "I wish to speak to a customer service" you will need to specify "I wish to speak to a human in customer service" if that's what you meant.
- [Cyberhaven raises $88M](https://www.techmeme.com/240611/p16?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240611p16) \- 🤖 Because "Jimmy" isn't typing in his credentials the way Jimmy usually types in his password today and that means *Jimmy* might not be the best Jimmy that Jimmy is supposed to be.
- [Seven AI raises $36M](https://www.techmeme.com/240606/p46?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240606p46) \- 🤖 Because Cybereasons (literally)
- [Tenderd AI raises $30M](https://www.techmeme.com/240611/p8?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240611p8) \- 🤖 Because as we burn more fossil fuels to energize A.I. processing capacity we can probably use... A.I. to wrangle emissions data.
- [Nexus Labs raises $25M](https://www.techmeme.com/240611/p3?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hot-takes-tuesday-for-2024-06-11#a240611p3) \- 🔐 Zero Knowledge is getting more interesting outside of niche communities now that the zkVM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) written in Rust stories are getting wider coverage.

### [🔙 Throwback Thursday](https://hot.fudge.org/archive/throwback-thursday-for-2024-06-13/)

If you were to look back at IPOs from 20 years ago, you’d probably recognize several companies. Considering just technology, a handful are quite notable.

- [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday-for-2024-06-13) - While it might be hard to imagine a time before Google, the company that once took attention away from the TV and drove us all to use browsers has expanded to… well, [go back after the TV under different terms](https://www.techmeme.com/240610/p41?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday-for-2024-06-13#a240610p41).
- [CBRE Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBRE_Group?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday-for-2024-06-13) \- If you've been to a major city with what appears to be empty buildings, it is worth noting that return to office (RTO) will likely become an equilibrium as the democratization of technology and [thinking remotely](https://fudge.org/archive/thinking-remotely/?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday-for-2024-06-13) and [data centers are growing more than ever in the REIT category](https://www.techmeme.com/240608/p8?utm_source=hot-fudge-daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=throwback-thursday-for-2024-06-13#a240608p8).

### [✅ Final Thoughts Friday](https://hot.fudge.org/archive/final-thoughts-friday-for-2024-06-14/)

It was a busy week. The final round table content from Qlik Connect in Orlando was posted to YouTube.

### [🔮 Sneak Peak Saturday](https://hot.fudge.org/archive/sneak-peak-saturday-for-2024-06-15/)

By Friday, everything seems to be reaching the peak of getting news turned in before a deadline or dread-line. 

It sometimes seems like we reach a fever pitch in news coverage throughout the week. Then there is a trope, cliché, or bromide about slow news days and the quietly mentioned news updates sent on a Friday — to try and sneak it past wider coverage. Or, in a nutshell, peak patronizing publishing.

In that spirit, here are the stories that you might have missed on the slow news of a Friday.
