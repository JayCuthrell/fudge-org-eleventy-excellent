I once [opined on Twitter](https://www.techmeme.com/211102/p20?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a211102p20) regarding web1, web2, and web3 as follows in response to [Zoom considering advertising](https://www.techmeme.com/211102/p20?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a211102p20) back on November 2, 2021:

Web1: No banner ads.

Web2: Sell banner ads.

Web3: Sell yourself as banner ads.

Perhaps Zoom will leverage their video filter ML/AI/AR by launching on persona advertising placement to the highest bidding brands.

 **Getting Informed**

This newsletter is not investment advice. I might dabble in Web3 things or I might not dabble in Web3 things.

Web3 is a polarizing topic across generations. In fact, I‚Äôm referring to Web3 instead of crypto because *crypto-* (hidden) gave way to *cryptocurrency* (hype) and there isn‚Äôt space to spill enough ink here to change the condition.

Things need to be built. Distraction delays progress.

I‚Äôm not giving up Web1 or Web2 and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs okay. You don‚Äôt have to either.

Some of my favorite Web1 things that take up room in my long term memory bank of a brain stopped working last month. Web1, Web2, and Web3 aren‚Äôt a contest or zero sum game.

I‚Äôm only suggesting that Web3 will increasingly be a reframed or repackaged way of avoiding references to *crypto* in describing what will be created in the coming years.

Looking for another phrasing zeitgeist prediction?

* *crypto* ‚õè = NGMI
* Web3 üèÑ = WAGMI

Said another way, you‚Äôre more likely to remember a fun participatory phrase like *‚Äú[surfing](https://www.netmom.com/surfing?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)‚Äù üèÑ* than ‚Äú*mining*‚Äù ‚õè in the coming Web3 years to follow. As such, when Web3 finds the best possible [word smithing](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/crypto-companies-are-hiring-public-relations-pros-2021-11?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), neologism, or analogy, we‚Äôre going to be participating in far greater numbers.

We just have‚Äôt had our Web3 [Polly](https://www.netmom.com/jean-armour-polly-cv?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) moment. Yet.

Sometimes I find it helpful to remember back when the early web was considered "silly" in the early 1990s and referred to as the "world wide wait".  
  
Then broadband happened.  
  
Then mobile happened.  
  
Then this platform allowed us to learn about "silly" new things. <https://t.co/LRpixWR6Hy>

 **So what comes after Web3?**

If I was pressed to think out beyond Web3, it would be something like this:

Web 0: first-tinkerer advantage

Web¬†1: first-commerce advantage

Web 2: first-marketer advantage

Web 3: first-feudal barrons advantage <‚Äì we are here

Web 4: first-geopolitical domination advantage

Web 5: first-idealogical unification advantage

So, until next time. Be safe and be well out there as we enter the first of several Web3 years to come.
