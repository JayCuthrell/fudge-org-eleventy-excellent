Yes. 6G! Here we were just waiting for 5G.

So, how long until we see a consumer accessible democratized access to the technology?

As of late 2021, you can now join a FaceTime call from an Android or Windows device. FaceTime links arrived in¬†iOS 15 and macOS Monterey meaning (almost) anyone can join a FaceTime call from a web browser.
