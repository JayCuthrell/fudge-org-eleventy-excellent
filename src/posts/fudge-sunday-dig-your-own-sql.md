Specifically, weâ€™ll focus on the episodes worth downloading to your podcasting app that are evergreen and worth more than a single listen alone.

 **Since the last issue: 20 minutes of me talking**

Last week I spoke in my capacity as a team member at [Faction](https://factioninc.com?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) about the topic of multi-cloud data services patterns within gaming and healthcare, convergence, and the world of AR / VR in our future.

 **Sunday morning and we're waking up**

Letâ€™s start with the big beats before we look at some of the podcast content from those that make big bets.

 **Where do we start?**

Catching up on the entire catalog of a16z podcasts would take quite a time investment. For perspective â€“ the catalog is already several years deep and the episode numbers are in the hundreds and [Episode 636 was posted in July 2021](https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/systems-leadership-brains-brawn-startups-incumbents-robert-siegel-book-OEYHPMNp?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

For this issue, three podcasts episodes will be examined from 2020 and a list of key podcast episodes from pre-2020 will be shared at the end.

When I was going for my undergrad degree in engineering I remember a quad conversation with a peer that opened my mind in the early 1990s. Like many conversations started in those days, we were discussing majors as one does.

At the time, I was enamored with the possibilities of materials science and engineering such as room temperature superconductors. My perspectives were quite limited.

My infectious enthusiasm aide, my peer indicated a deeper desire to be one of the problem solvers of the next generation. So, I asked what that meant.

What that meant was a dual major. The dual majors would be physics *and* philosophy.

When this combination was explained to me, my mind was altered.

Emoji didnâ€™t exist then but I probably looked like this: ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤¯

As recovering physicists, Peter and Martin cover everything from SQL to data warehouses to Python to business data analytics to Hadoop and the growing data science debates around everything from organizational approaches to development tools.

Next, letâ€™s look at some of two key data related debates coming from a year ago as we look ahead to the future.

Again, this podcast episode is one of the recently transcribed as blog post that a16z has introduced recently. As Iâ€™ve said before, Sonal and her a16z team are absolutely amazing.

This podcast episode is one of my favorite for a long drive. Why? Itâ€™s equally entertaining and informative.

Youâ€™ll get a relational vs. retrieval perspective from a Fivetran event that includes executive perspectives like those of Snowflake, Noteable, and dbt Labs.

While the conversation is only around a half hour, the discussion on use cases, tooling, APIs, SQL, and other access patterns are covered in a depth you rarely find in panels with this many participants.

 **Pre-2020 listening**

Again, there are hundreds of a16z podcasts episodes.

However, if you are interested in the topics covered in this issue of my newsletter and want to listen to the prior conversations that might have influenced them (and my newsletter), enjoy these podcast episodes a well.
