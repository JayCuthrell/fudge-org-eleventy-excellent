## Getting Informed

Imagine someone telling you in your early career that it would be increasingly common for multiple companies to [share a single CEO](https://onlinemba.wsu.edu/blog/ceos-who-lead-more-than-one-company) — especially so when it comes to [a particular social networking platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter).

Does that seem to be [a bit far-fetched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey)?

Does that appear to be [somewhat oddly improbable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)?

And yet... here we are in 2024. But, what about other kinds of leadership roles in the C-suite?

My peer network has educated me recently on the growing market for [fractional executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_executive) and fractional leadership roles. In a nutshell, the use of fractional executive roles is ideal for companies needing strategic executive support without the overhead of a full-time hire.

Of course, the notion of a fractional executive role is not new and likely dates back to [a _Gretchen_ from at least 20 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fractional_CIO&oldid=3101807). Indeed, [the _Regina_ contingent could not hold back the tide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pubd-spHN-0).

### Communities for Fractionals

During my education, peers directed me to several [deep web](/topics/deep-web) communities and service providers that cater to fractionals on the spectrum of curious to aspirational to seasoned.

- [Fractionals United](https://www.fractionalsunited.com)
- [Business Talent Group (now part of Heidrick & Struggles)](https://businesstalentgroup.com/services/interim-cio-cto)

Coverage of fractional roles will likely increase as well but a few articles that summarize or link back to fractional resources are worth sharing.

- [SDxCentral: Why tech companies should consider fractional executives](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/feature/why-tech-companies-should-consider-fractional-executives/2023/10/) by [Esther Shein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshein/)
- [HR Brew: Why some HR departments consider fractional execs when filling leadership positions](https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2024/01/03/why-some-hr-departments-consider-fractional-execs-when-filling-leadership-positions) by [Mikaela Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikaelamc/)

Of course, lately, the meme of A.I. replacing the C-suite roles is more provocative to consider. So, I also went back to work published by McKinsey over the years on the so-called "Fractional FTE" envisioned as automation adoption drives down time requirements for various roles.

- [McKinsey (2011): The US employment challenge](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/the-us-employment-challenge-perspectives-from-carl-camden-and-michael-spence) 🔮 🤯
- [McKinsey (2015): Connecting talent with opportunity in the digital age](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/connecting-talent-with-opportunity-in-the-digital-age)
- [McKinsey (2016): Independent work: Choice, necessity, and the gig economy](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy)
- [McKinsey (2018): The route to no-touch planning](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/the-route-to-no-touch-planning)

Based on my initial research, the use of fractional to describe roles accurately is mixed in these modern times. Buzzwords are contagious like that. 🔥🤣

For example, the phrase "contract to hire" or "interim role" appears as _search & replace_ ready for "Fractional to start then can become full-time" or similar variations. In effect, this might be an interim role by another name. 🧐

By contrast, companies with a skilled board of directors would likely consider tapping an existing board member with specific expertise for an interim role in anticipation of (or in response to) a C-suite departure that will require the full-time C-suite role to be backfilled. ♟️

Of course, it ultimately depends. The hard and fast rules of fractional leadership hiring are becoming clearer as I learn more from the community. 🤔

For example, sometimes full-time executives need to step away for a bit and sometimes those executives never return. Another example might be the period of scaling up in marketing, finance, or operations that does not justify a full-time hire — until it does. 📈

As there is potential for confusion with the term _fractional_, it is useful to refer to the aptly named landing page _[Fractional Defined](https://www.fractionaldefined.com)_ from [Fractionals United](https://www.fractionalsunited.com). 🤓

For my part, I'm very [_Camp Gretchen_](https://cuthrell.consulting/services/fcoo/) now too and thinking about the unique short-term needs of companies during times of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. 🕴️

What's the eventual equilibrium going to look like for full-time roles and fractional roles across emerging technology companies?

Until then... place your bets.

p.s. As I've gotten older, I have come to appreciate getting snail mail.
