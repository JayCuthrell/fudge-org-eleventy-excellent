I'm heading to Austin, Texas next month for SXSW 2025.


*Will you be at SXSW 2025 too?* [^contact]

[^contact]: [Review my SXSW 2025 schedule picks](https://schedule.sxsw.com/favorite/user/985f8ae425a0ca54469639ae92234564491ace14) to see if we can sit together or catch up after to discuss what we just heard and experienced. If you prefer alternatives, use my [contact info](https://jaycuthrell.com/contact).

## Getting Informed

For perspective, this year [(like last year)](/archive/notes-before-sxsw-2024) will not be an attempt to live blog SXSW. Once again, I will revisit [this same post](/archive/notes-before-sxsw-2024) over the nine (9!) days of SXSW 2024 and send the final update as a regular Fudge Sunday update.

To give you an idea of just how _oversubscribed_ I am for SXSW 2025, I've parsed my schedule as follows for Interactive, Film, and Music:
