 **Getting Informed**

Back in 2009, one of my favorite presentation topics covered the trends that facilities based broadband service providers should know about. It was a pattern of research that I have tried to keep up over the years.

Ultra-Wideband (UWB) was just one of the trends I was interested in at the time. My specific interest was due to increasingly diverse mobile device form factors including smart(er) phones and the ability to pair more devices with their own RF capabilities to form a [personal area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

**[Personal area network - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)**

*“A personal area network ([PAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) is a computer network for interconnecting electronic devices within an individual person’s workspace.”*

A few years later I tweeted a reminder for anyone that may have forgotten how pervasive and ubiquitous the devices around us were becoming. I even used all capital letters to mimic the memes of the time and it was heavily retweeted manually and (re)appropriated as was the custom before the retweet button came into existence later that year.

As such, I would recommend digesting the [Techmeme metacoverage of UWB](https://www.techmeme.com/220109/p2?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a220109p2) as it becomes newsworthy (again?). Essentially, the concept of my tweet from over a decade ago has not changed but the pervasive and ubiquitous arrival of UWB will be far more uniform in our near future.
