This week we take a look at what's next in post-pandemic travel and apps potpourri.

## Housekeeping

I've just returned from [Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit) in Denver this week where I spent time with the amazing folks at [Elevate Technology User Group](https://bit.ly/43vhHwD).

The best part of events like [Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit) is the community and sharing of knowledge.

BTW, if you missed any of my LinkedIn updates during Red Hat Summit, I've summarized them in a LinkedIn Article. (see below)

### Looking ahead

üóìÔ∏è Later this month, I am headed to [Dell Technologies World](https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/events/delltechnologiesworld/2024/index.htm) in Las Vegas. If you'll be in Las Vegas too, let's meet at [Elevate Technology User Group](https://bit.ly/etug-at-dtw-2024). Register now: <https://bit.ly/etug-at-dtw-2024> üé´ üéüÔ∏è

üóìÔ∏è Next month, I am honored to be a [Tech Field Day delegate](https://techfieldday.com/people/jay-cuthrell/) at [Qlik Connect](https://www.qlikconnect.com/) in Orlando.

üóìÔ∏è Want to combine forces or see your event listed here? [Let's chat!](https://cuthrell.consulting/contact/)

### More content in more places

üÜïüÜï I created [my personal "Articles" section on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaycuthrell/recent-activity/articles/). To be clear, I will still be updating [fudge.org](/) and [Fudge Sunday for LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaycuthrell/recent-activity/newsletter/) ü§ì

For example, my latest [LinkedIn Article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/guess-who-back-circulation-jay-cuthrell-9byle/) is a summary of my updates from Red Hat Summit last week.

üè¶ üéôÔ∏è üéß Reminder: My appearance on [Fred Cadena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredcadena/)'s [Banking on Disruption](https://bankingondisruption.com) podcast will dive into SXSW 2024 findings, FinTech, and much more.

ü¶Ñ üèá üéôÔ∏è üéß Reminder: My own [Unicorn Jockeys](https://unicornjockeys.com) podcast will be making use of [A.I.](/topics/ai) and I'm excited to see where this all goes.

Now, back to our regularly scheduled Fudge Sunday newsletter! ü§ì

## Getting Informed

Traveling for work has changed for me. Arguably, traveling for work is still changing for me.

I share this bromide as someone who spent a lot of time in planes, trains, automobiles, and years of life in hotels around the world. This trend, for me, will likely continue for a few more years.

From 1995 to 2009, [I traveled a lot](/archive/and-for-my-next-trick/) both domestically and internationally. So, when TripIt launched in 2006 I began tracking things more closely and connected it to work travel in 2009.

According to [TripIt](https://news.sap.com/2020/01/tripit-update-flight-carbon-footprint/), my carbon footprint keeps growing.

- Distance Traveled: 2M+ miles
- Total Days: 3000+
- Total Trips: 1000+
- Countries/Regions Visited: 15+
- Cities Visited: 300+
- Carbon Footprint: [400+ tCO2](/archive/its-not-easy-being-greendevsecfinops/) ü§Ø

According to TripIt, my air travel since 2009 is equivalent to powering ~50 US homes for a year. To offset just the most recent carbon footprint associated with air travel alone, I'd need to [plant around 60k trees on the landmass equivalent to the ~30 stadiums in use by Major League Baseball (MLB) teams](https://8billiontrees.com/carbon-offsets-credits/how-many-trees-to-offset-1-ton-of-co2/). Now, my math might be off here ‚Äî but one could argue [remote work for knowledge workers has distinct advantages](/archive/airwaves-vs-airlines/) as compared to work travel and commuting for work.

Also, [according to McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/sustainable-inclusive-growth/chart-of-the-day/aircraft-backlog-keeps-climbing), the backlog for aircraft is staggeringly large (~16k open-order backlog) which means the demand to _increase_ our collective carbon footprint is staggeringly large too. Looking ahead, similar to our fixation with nutritional labeling in the US, I expect that every travel brand will present the carbon footprint of the experience in [an increasingly conspicuous manner](https://www.travelperk.com/blog/best-carbon-footprint-tracker-apps/).

What to do? Well, my morning walk to co-working in [The Vault](https://workinthevault.com) is my act locally think globally action of late.

### Plan of record

[Michael Cote's Wastebook and Wunderkammer](https://newsletter.cote.io/p/devops-used-to-manage-35-of-enterprise) shared a great idea for any newsletter: Including key dates and places you plan to be in the newsletter. For the last few Fudge Sunday weekly updates, I adopted the practice as well.

Essentially, you'll increase the probability of happy collisions by letting more folks know where you'll be ahead of time. I tried this with TripIt for a while before the [SAP/Concur M&A turducken](https://news.sap.com/2020/01/tripit-update-flight-carbon-footprint/).

While I'm not sharing exactly where I'll be in real-time, it is close enough to further coordinate with others at events. In terms of [OpSec](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/operations_security), those days of beaconing location via Foursquare are long gone whereas [a decade ago, I connected my real-time Foursquare check-in location to my blog posts via a simplistic IFTTT recipe](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jcuthrell/12898221854).

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jcuthrell/12898221854/in/photolist-9pBd2c-ax3zPr-9TR3QS-aEtyy1-aCgxvg-aDQCp6-dfTvVx-dxo8Ey-dj7GmK-dCkr7v-aDMhxo-9pDY75-9R7sSA-9ZBdkS-dqsXC5-9ZCJEH-dsH7Gn-dC7G3P-dfKn2D-dhTmG2-duwheT-9pDT2T-9TzWxb-9D4Ksg-9Nvu87-doQD1u-dAXYwB-dt5ddH-aDHVHi-aFgTPx-aEZzMF-dAkRrH-9WdmsW-9ZHk3A-cHWbJN-cQo1gh-dfS7ZX-9NrS3t-dseXQC-djapPm-9UXews-9UoqYp-9XEtLD-9UqR3q-9WzPEL-9X9jH9-9WwQxr-9WzLoG-kDHZKD-kDLKZq" title="One of the cool things I..."><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7441/12898221854_199a715d3c_z.jpg" width="612" height="612" alt="One of the cool things I..."/></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While I do miss the immediacy of fun IFTTT integrations, OpSec times changed. As such, work travel has changed.

### There is always an app

When air travel cannot be avoided, one app that I am finding to be very helpful is [Flighty](https://www.flightyapp.com). I don't know _how_ it does it but it manages to be _better_ than the _native airline apps_ I use for flight status, ETA, and other fun visualizations of the trip underway.

Another app I've rediscovered recently is [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com). Again, I've lived years of my life in Marriot properties, Hilton properties, and the like ‚Äî and changing it up by getting to experience non-hotel surroundings and public transport has been educational.

For ground transportation, I've enjoyed cities where investments in public transportation and their apps are evident.

- [CapMetro](https://www.capmetro.org/app) in Austin
- [BART](https://www.bart.gov/guide/apps) in San Francisco
- [MARTA](https://www.itsmarta.com/marta-on-the-go.aspx) in Atlanta
- [RTD](https://www.rtd-denver.com/open-records/open-spatial-information/mobile-apps) in Denver
- [TripLinx](https://www.triplinx.ca/en/more-information-on-our-website-and-androidios-app/1013) in Toronto

### Where to next

Setting aside so-called ["Revenge Travel"](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/what-ai-means-for-travel-now-and-in-the-future) for 2024, I expect that client meetings will drive 75% of my work travel. For [the remaining 25%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/04/29/rick-steves-home-partner-philanthropy-washington/?ref=spyglass.org), there are other options.

A few more apps that I've rediscovered are [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/l/eventbrite-app/), [Luma](https://lu.ma/discover), [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/apps/), and [Whova](https://whova.com/whova-event-app/). These apps are useful when you know you are going to be in a city for an event or conference and want to understand what parallel serendipitous events might also overlap with your stay.

There are also aggregator websites to consider. Great curation often begins on a website vs. an app.

For example, [Techmeme Events](https://www.techmeme.com/events) are my new favorite list of TripIt placeholders. After all, I am back in circulation now.

You might imagine that some smart startup out there is already working on getting [A.I.](/topics/ai) to synthesize all of the above for bespoke personalized serendipitous itinerary options. You are not wrong.

- [And many many more](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/travel-planning?order=most_followed)

What's the next big technology evolution going to be in work travel?

Until then... place your bets.
