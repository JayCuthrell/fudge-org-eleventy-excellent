 **Getting Informed**

Keeping up with a regular newsletter has been educational as well as challenging. In fact, some of the best examples of inspired productivity took place immediately after publishing on a Sunday evening.

While I won’t go as far as saying I actively seek opportunities for working in a callback, this issue of the newsletter will provide a chance to use the shot and chaser meme. Or, I will do my best to cherry pick where I got close enough to say I was probably onto something.

 **Mining our dreams for the same old song 🎶**

One of the irritating aspects of writing a newsletter that goes out via email is as soon as you submit – – – you realize you made a spelling error or a grammatical error etc. of course. Luckily, the web version of the newsletter can be edited and corrected after the email campaign has completed.

So, for the next few links I will call back to a previous issue of the newsletter where I may have been close or somewhat accurate in my prediction of companies or technologies that had a successful outcome. And yes, this was also an excuse to go back and make some edits to problematic spelling and grammar along the way.

Let’s take an example or two and wrap this up with a read and a repo.

If you remember [“What’s a Server?”](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-what-s-a-server-717468?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) [August 2021](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-what-s-a-server-717468?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) then you might recall the section on Pensando Systems after raising +$300M.

In March I reflected on multicloud but waited until after April 1st 2021 to post it because the Internet. So, April 10, 2021 it was. I still maintain that my predictions in [Social Telecom 2030](https://fudge.org/archive/social-telecom-2030?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) will eventually become true…

One step closer… On April 7, 2022 the AWS announced that [customers will no longer incur an inter-AZ data transfer charge](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/aws-data-transfer-price-reduction-privatelink-transit-gateway-client-vpn-services/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for sending data across availability zones for AWS PrivateLink, AWS Transit Gateway, and AWS Client VPN.
