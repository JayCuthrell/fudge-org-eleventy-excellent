# Getting Informed

Over the years, analyst firms such as Gartner have continuously surveyed organizations on the use of A.I. in the Enterprise to understand what percentage have implemented some form of A.I. â€” and the data shows a clear progression. In fact, from 2015-2019 per Gartner, there was [almost 300% growth](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-01-21-gartner-survey-shows-37-percent-of-organizations-have).

Today, there is no denying independent software vendors (ISVs) with large incumbent install bases will look at A.I. as a way to maintain relevance and increased value year over year. Said another way, A.I. has become a spicy mix of [FOMO](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/why-feature-fomo-stalls-product-innovation/) and value stream mapping originated customer expectations for many product leaders in the ISV marketplace.

But first... it's time for reading ðŸ“–, listening ðŸŽ§, and watching ðŸ“º suggestions:

- First, [ðŸ“– What's ðŸ”¥ in Enterprise IT/VC #358](https://www.whatshotit.vc/p/whats-in-enterprise-itvc-358) in which [Ed Sim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edsim/) details the A.I. hype, hubris, and humanity across the VC landscape chasing both Enterprise (B2B) and Consumer (B2C) dreams of ever higher valuations.

- Second, [ðŸŽ§ Updates to Infrastructure as Code](https://www.thecloudcast.net/2023/09/updates-to-infrastructure-as-code.html) in which [Aaron Delp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarondelp/) and [Brian Gracely](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briangracely/) interview [Joe Duffy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joejduffy/) on keeping the developer experience top of mind.

- Third, [ðŸ“º Developer Experience & Productivity with Internal Developer Platforms](https://webinar.gartner.com/469517/agenda/session/1106362?login=ML) in which [Arun Batchu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunbatchu/), [Jim Mosher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmosher1/), [Dan Morneau](https://www.gartner.com/analyst/95673), and [Jim Elliott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimelliott6/) of Gartner provide a perspective on the promise of developer experience tooling and internal developer platforms.

## Forever's gonna slow you down ðŸŽ¶

What are some examples of A.I. appearing in the ISV marketplace?

Coming up with a list of the top Enterprise focused ISVs would vary by specific verticals or industries and are increasingly in the late stage SaaS curve of ISV maturity. However, for this newsletter, I've picked four (4) from the exhaustive list of 50 ISVs on the [G2 "Best Software for Enterprise Business for 2023"](https://www.g2.com/best-software-companies/enterprise).

- Atlassian
- ServiceNow
- Workday
- Salesforce

Why these ISVs? Each of these ISVs has cash to acquire other M.L. and A.I. related companies.

Now, let's examine the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) thesis for M.L. and A.I. related companies for each ISV.

## I think the end is mine to write ðŸŽ¶

Atlassian:  The [Percept.AI acquisition](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-acquires-percept) in early 2022 took place before [Atlassian Intelligence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/artificial-intelligence) was announced earlier this year in 2023.

Until thenâ€¦ Place your bets!
