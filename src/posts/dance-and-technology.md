If you forgot you were on this list, there is probably a GDPR way to get off the list. Enjoy the first (13?) installment of Fudge Sunday.

Newsletters and podcasts galore

Since attempting a newsletter years ago, I’ve decided to try again.

My last attempt turned in a dozen entries and I attempted to convert them (badly) into blog posts. But, they were not blog posts.

Lately I’m listening to a smaller number of podcasts but the one podcast that has been consistent is a16z.

Good stuff.

I also tried reading multiple newsletters. Everyone I listen to or read online eventually recommends Stratechery but I can’t seem to get into it. I tried the Stratechery podcast too – but, like the site and newsletter, I failed to get it. To each their own…

YMMV.

Another writer with a regular newsletter is M.G. Siegler. His writing is consistently thought provoking and it’s also found on Revue.

Good stuff.

Blogging. 20 years later.

I blogged twice this year already and it wasn’t even a new years resolution.

Looking back on the past 20 years of blogging

While I wasn’t blogging over the past 20 years, I was probably trying out just about every tool online. That included social networks – the successful ones and the other kind. Like… Google+ (plus?)

Lessons from a Googe+ data export

While me blogging heavily again may not become a trend, I’m planing to get a newsletter out each Sunday. That trend starts with this installment of the newsletter. Thanks for reading!

Dance and Technology
====================

If you had told me that dance and technology could collide in the future, I would probably have assumed it was something relating to anti-gravity or bionics. Nope. It was a collision in the legal realm.

Back in 2015, the topic of dance choreography was playing out…

[Who Owns a Dance? The Complexities of Copyrighting Choreography - Law Street](https://lawstreetmedia.com/issues/entertainment-and-culture/owns-dance-complexities-copyrighting-choreography/?utm_campaign=Fudge%20Sunday&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

What are the copyright rules when it comes to choreography? Who owns what dances, and how are they licensed?

Now, fast forward to 2019 and the world is almost turning into a scene out of “Looker” by Michael Crichton from the 1980s which is (no spoilers) literally the scenario of cutting the artist out of the cost equation.

Waaaaay ahead of its time.

As it turns out, the kid I remembered dancing on a soda pop commercial with the king of pop is embroiled in a dystopian deleterious dance deliberation!

I had to Google flossing. True story.

And…. scene?

The essential tech news of the moment. Technology’s news site of record. Not for dummies.

One Last Thing…

Speaking of the 80s… here’s another dancing related video that has all the ingredients of similar dance moves captured in a novel format and uploaded to YouTube – which is also no stranger to legal debates.

Very 1980s.
