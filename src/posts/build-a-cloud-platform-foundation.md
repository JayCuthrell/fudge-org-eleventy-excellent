Getting Informed
================

This post will cover topics that matter to developers and organizations that seek to attract developers. Those topics will range from legacy terminology such as DevOps, newer terminology like ‚Äúplatform engineering‚Äù or developer experience (DevX/DevEx), and the importance of a cloud platform foundation that provides landing zones that are aligned the goals of a developer community.

To be clear, *legacy* would be defined as a working solution or approach. So, *new* would be defined as a to-be-determined working solution or approach.

--------------------------------------

First, you may recall developer experience, or DexEx/DevX, from past posts back in December 2021 and March 2022. In short, developer experience is the empathy that an organization expresses for their developers to enable and empower them.

For context, one definition of *‚Äúplatform engineering‚Äù* comes from a relatively new[1](#footnote-1) website of the same name:


> *Platform engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era.*[2](#footnote-2)
> 
> 

Some would argue that, culturally, DevOps has less appeal in a truly developer experience focused organization. As such, the developer experience focus means shared goals that obviate operational responsibilities.[3](#footnote-3) 

Others, like Gartner, might argue that hype cycles play out over time and ‚ÄúPlatform Engineering‚Äù will plateau in 2-5 years.[4](#footnote-4) That said, it is important to consider that emerging technologies might represent a catalyst to the embrace and adoption or convergence of other emerging technologies.

At this point, you might be saying 

*‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve heard this before‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about a single pane of glass, right?‚Äù*

Indeed, others have strong opinions on pane of glass approaches.[5](#footnote-5)

I‚Äôd only remind you that *pane* is a homonym with *pain*. ü§ì

To summarize, there are four (4) key questions to answer in digital organizations:

1. Do you enable a culture that attract developers?
2. Do you have a clear platform engineering strategy?
3. Do you promote using a DevX/DevEx minded cloud platform foundation?
4. Do you further enrich the foundation with developer goal landing zones?

Until next time‚Ä¶ Place your bets!
