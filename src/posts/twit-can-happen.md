Getting Informed
================

This week take a look at the recent challenges for Twitter, [content drift](https://twitter.com/zittrain/status/1395754434781716485), [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot), and archivist considerations.

To understand the impact of Twitter, consider how simple it is to refer to a Tweet now.

1. Copy link to a Tweet
2. Paste link to Tweet
3. Depending on the 3rd-party platform, a Tweet is embedded as a Twitter Card[1](#footnote-1)

Actually, you don‚Äôt have to imagine because the new owners of Twitter have already imagined it.

Both Musk and Sacks have discussed the idea in recent meetings, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Would you have to pay to unlock the Twitter Card?

Would legacy Tweets be exempted from such a paywall?

It can happen to everyone eventually üé∂

Also, in the wake of the transaction, my thoughts go out to the Twitter team members being impacted by the changes being made as well as my congratulations to those that found a hopefully positive liquidity event.

It's a constant fight üé∂
-----------------------

When I was blogging more than I was tweeting, I considered the fight against [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) differently than the way than I do now. Granted, the signal and noise 14 years ago where I imagined a squelch knob[2](#footnote-2) was before I considered writing a newsletter again.[3](#footnote-3)

Why does [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) matter? For the same reason domain names are perishable. 

As the saying goes‚Ä¶ what would possibly go wrong? [Content drift](https://twitter.com/zittrain/status/1395754434781716485).

Of course, barring more Twitter changes to banned users, this particular example, you would need to have a screenshot before this prank could be viewed again.[4](#footnote-4)

Developing words that linger üé∂
------------------------------

Perhaps the solution is to archive. By archive, I mean archive in the sense as suggested by Shawn M. Jones, Martin Klein, and Herbert Van de Sompel.[5](#footnote-5)

For example, if Twitter is truly operating at startup speed and wants to normalize revenue from advertising with valued added services ‚Äî make the archive step just as easy and *robust*.

* Will there be edge cases like editing or deleting problematic Tweets? Yes.
* Will that matter? Perhaps not nearly as much as we might think.

Also, the Tweet for Pay motif might actually survive the A/B testing phase. I tried Twitter Blue briefly to make [a video of editing a Tweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SURvQgYJiag) for my own testing but that might be just the beginning of a true content management offering.

Back in 2014, I figured that Twitter years with Ev Williams[6](#footnote-6) would eventually lead to the reconstitution of Blogger with each successive wave of new Twitter enhancements. Now, I only remembered my prognostication because it became less far fetched as I reviewed my Twitter Archives again in 2017.[7](#footnote-7)

So, at the risk of a shot and chaser playback‚Ä¶ sometimes, I‚Äôm scary accurate.
