# Getting Informed

This week we take a look at Zero Trust, Zero Trust Model, Zero Trust Security Model, Zero Trust Reference Architecture, Zero Trust Network Access, and Zero Trust Network Architecture. So, if this seems like an elongated list now, you should have zero *‚Äî ahem ‚Äî* trust the list will be the last of the variants.

# And they may not want it to end üé∂

For me, ‚ÄúZero Trust‚Äù is simply a shorter way of saying ‚ÄúTrust No One‚Äù using 9 characters and 1 space (2 words) instead of 10 characters and 2 spaces (3 words). Both work just as well for haiku with 3 syllables each.

*i had a budget  
zero trust ate it quickly  
vendor paid for lunch*

*trust no one they said  
set allow all to deny  
no perimeter*

There are many ways to refer to zero trust. As you might expect, the variations on what gets appended to ‚Äúzero trust‚Äù goes on and on depending on the service provider or solution/software security vendor.

Here's a quick sample across companies, products, government, and the Internet book of knowledge:

* Google = zero trust model = BeyondCorp[1](#footnote-1)
* Tailscale = Zero Trust Networking = Incremental[2](#footnote-2)
* Cisco = Zero Trust Security = Borderless Networks[3](#footnote-3)
* VMware = Zero Trust Network Segmentation = Micro-segmentation[4](#footnote-4)
* F5 = Zero Trust = NGINX Secure Connectivity[5](#footnote-5)
* NIST = Zero Trust Architecture = NCCoE[6](#footnote-6)
* US DoD = Zero Trust Reference Architecture = DISA + NSA[7](#footnote-7)
* Wikipedia = Zero Trust Security Model = aka ZTA, ZTNA[8](#footnote-8)

# It's hard when you're always afraid üé∂

Zero trust jargon is arguably at least a decade old. Partly, this is due to the growth of virtual private networks (VPN) and the challenge of VPN deployments along with implementation frustration.

If you've ever had to use a VPN regularly, you know it is better than having to drive into an office ‚Äî but the novelty wears off quickly. And if you‚Äôve ever met me, you know I refer to VPN as the acronym for vexing productivity neutralizer.[9](#footnote-9)

Still, I have been using VPN since the late 1990s and still do. However, my mood changed when there was the glimmer of hope from companies like Tailscale.[10](#footnote-10)

# There can hardly be a question of why üé∂

Ultimately, the why this matters is due to our societal appetites for what comes next. Eventually, how end users interact and how developers create the things end users interact with will lead to lower friction experiences.

From Cisco‚Äôs early ‚ÄúBorderless Networks‚Äù in the early 2010s to the modern day rush to prepend every product name with ‚Äúzero trust‚Äù, it was the early work at Google (BeyondCorp circa 2009-ish[11](#footnote-11)) that set the expectation bar: things should just work without an extra layer of software (VPN client) or steps (logging in with the VPN client) for the ideal user experience.

BTW, I remember blogging about Google Secure Access VPN in 2005 as part of their beta (everything is a beta) service called Google WiFi. Yes, it was a thing and ‚Äî like most Google things ‚Äî it went away eventually.[12](#footnote-12)
