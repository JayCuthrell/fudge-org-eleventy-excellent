Consider that there are still arguably [millions of other data centers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/500458/worldwide-datacenter-and-it-sites/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) from privately held data centers to colocation data centers to specific niche hosting provider data centers. Also, there are clever essays on what if scenarios that challenge the notion of everything going public cloud on a long enough timeline and [coming back, via a [checks notes] Trillion Dollars repatriation, home to the core](https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

Consolidation will continue of course, but not always in the direction that a biased pundit might think. Further, not all data centers will ever achieve a hyperscale size, but they will likely become advantaged through the full democratization of hyperscale techniques, tooling, and telemetry.

Ultimately, any belief that only ever larger data centers will be built around the planet to be owned and operated by a small capital enriched number of companies is simply not clear. However, what is clear as edge, core, and cloud requirements shift, is this: *[the distributed edge data centers are going to happen slowly then seem to appear all at once](https://www.opengridalliance.org/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)*.

More importantly, localized data centers are probably going to increase, and this makes sense if youâ€™ve ever thought about where data is being created â€“ the edges of a network are far more interesting than sports stadium sized data centers that show up on satellite imagery.

Back in 2015, we might have debated how spatial and temporal data markets could evolve with drone captured data companies, satellite captured data companies, and emerging ML/AI companies.  
  
Now it's likely the market will reward accretive combinations via M&A for all of the above. <https://t.co/LsGfbi9oMU>

So as social becomes just media and media tries to become more social, it will be important to keep our collective sense of humor (if there can be one) by anchoring to the export of memeâ€¦ or, if you will, ensuring access to the *memeâ€™s of production* ;-)
