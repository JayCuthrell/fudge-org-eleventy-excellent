 **Getting Informed**

The year was 2010. I had an iPhone.

I was speaking on a panel at an [OPASTCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTCA_-_The_Rural_Broadband_Association?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) event and tried livestreaming then resorted to using [Qik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_Qik?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). A 10 second video clip was posted of the *livestream* to¬†[Posterous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) which automatically sent a Tweet using its URL shortener to fit into 140 characters.

I was trying to live in the future. However, AT&T had me living in the past.

To say that AT&T was not keeping up with the demand of 3G would be a bit of a euphemism. Of course, it wasn‚Äôt just me [taking notice](https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/att-is-a-big-steaming-heap-of-failure/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) during those [early days](https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/11/att-outage/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) of iPhone marketing success.

While network capacity engineering for mobile is always challenging, AT&T had to catch up with the 2009 era demand for data of iPhone users in 2010. So, coincidentally, later the same week as I spoke and struggled to share a video, AT&T committed ~$20B to **[triple the capacity of fiber-optic cables](https://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/01/29/att.network.boost/index.html?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)** to existing cell sites and add 2000 more cell sites as compared to the prior year.

Investments in universal broadband from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will connect every American to live-saving telehealth, remote learning, and e-commerce.   
  
It‚Äôs time to close the digital divide.

Recent press coverage in 2021 shows strong correlation in county level mapping of the digital divide. Basically, broadband gaps result from a lack of fiber-optic capacity that, in turn, stifles economic activity.

Today, while our multicloud world isn‚Äôt entirely because of the iPhone, there are are some patterns that do indeed repeat. So, keep in mind that Alphabet / Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and even Meta / Facebook have all been busy laying undersea [fiber-optic cables](https://www.techmeme.com/220115/p10?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#a220115p10) for years.
