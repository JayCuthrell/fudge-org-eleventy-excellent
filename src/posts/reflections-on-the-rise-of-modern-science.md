There is an ancient saying...

> Those who do not study history, are doomed to... [checks notes] take an alternative course that satisfies the elective requirements to graduate in their matriculated degree program.

While I'm no history major, thirty (30!) years ago I did take a history course: "HI 322 - THE RISE OF MODERN SCIENCE". If you ask me what I remember — I remember learning about [phlogiston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory). 

Sadly, courses like "HI 322 - THE RISE OF MODERN SCIENCE" should have been one of my favorite courses — but in reality, I barely passed it. I play back the reasons why even today and it might have something to do with... being preoccupied with that which would become the domain of knowledge I'd build upon for the next thirty (30!) years.

I did take a few more history courses [that shaped my way of thinking](https://fudge.org/archive/esteem-is-stem-plus-ethics-plus-empathy/). However, as scholastic penance this week, I decided to go down a rabbit hole of the past 30 years of big things that happened in a timeline that have shaped much (all?) of my career.

The following thirty (30!) year listicle is not meant to be a year over year exhaustive deep dive. Think of the listicle as more of a higlight reel of loosely related topics that might compound, converge, or convolute any number of possible futures.

## 2020

It has been three (3!) years since I left my longest running stint with the same company through [a series of concurrent nested mergers and acquisiions](https://fudge.org/archive/my-tenth-year-at-dell-technologies/).

## 1993

It has been thirty (30!) years since the first ripples of the World Wide Web became more widely recognized through interactions with the [web browser](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/30/1172276538/world-wide-web-internet-anniversary), the growing notion of an [eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September), the birth of the [Pentium processor](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/when-speed-was-king-vinod-dham-and-the-birth-of-the-pentium/), and [initial operational capability (IOC) for civilian use of GPS](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/gps/).

So, what happens next?

As I often say... 

Until then… Place your bets!
