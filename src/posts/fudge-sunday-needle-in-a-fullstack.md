The Velvelettes "Needle in a Haystack" (1965)

 **Getting Informed**

First, let‚Äôs expand some [DevSec](https://disruptops.com/devsecops-vs-devsecops/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) acronyms and give some examples. As a starter, you‚Äôll want to recall the concept of a [‚Äúsoftware bill of materials‚Äù](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) ([SBOM](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) from [Fudge Sunday #55](https://sunday.fudge.org/issues/fudge-sunday-everything-counts-in-ops-amounts-1073115?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a method for looking at all the code that wasn‚Äôt written (by you or your team) but was inherited from somewhere else externally along the development journey and now represents a dependency. Or, to understand why SCA is important, please consider [Dependency](https://xkcd.com/2347/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) aka [xkcd 2347](https://xkcd.com/2347/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

[![There's always a xkcd for everything](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/13c8151f-a0b0-42d3-9458-cb50f6d09c58_600x762.png "There's always a xkcd for everything")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13c8151f-a0b0-42d3-9458-cb50f6d09c58_600x762.png)There's always a xkcd for everything

 **üé∂ I'm tellin' you the natural facts üé∂**

Application Security Testing (xAST) is a generalized approach for static (SAST), dynamic (DAST), or interactive (IAST) scanning methods when testing for vulnerabilities. Now, if this sounds like a [shift-left disruption ready market](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/services/2022/03/13/devops-to-devsecops-a-worthwhile-investment/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), keep reading.

Run-time Application Security Protection (RASP) can be a specific wrapper approach that assumes a specific known context for the internal design of specific software. The RASP approach also enabled the creation of the Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) market because everything that *could* become an API *will* become an API on a long enough timeline.

Examples of companies from A to Z in this space include *(with deep links to an educational blog post)* [AppDome](https://www.appdome.com/blog/avoid-the-hidden-costs-of-building-secure-mobile-apps/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/blog/the-open-source-supply-chain-under-assault-new-defenses-are-required/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Contrast](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/why-the-difference-between-sast-dast-and-iast-matters?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Data Theorem](https://www.datatheorem.com/blog/securing-the-ci-cd-pipeline-in-pre-production?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/blog/api-gateway-or-not-you-need-api-security/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Invicti](https://www.invicti.com/blog/web-security/dast-iast-sca-deeper-coverage-single-scan/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Micro Focus](https://blog.microfocus.com/digital-transformation-a-proverbial-balancing-act/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Onapsis](https://onapsis.com/blog/five-reasons-why-you-need-vulnerability-management-business-critical-applications-part5?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Qualys](https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/2022/02/15/the-unbearable-lightness-of-unaudited-supply-chains?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/03/02/insightappsec-github-integration-keeps-risky-code-from-reaching-production/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Snyk](https://snyk.io/blog/improve-cloud-coverage-reduce-infrastructure-drift/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/software-bill-of-materials-bom/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [Veracode](https://www.veracode.com/blog/intro-appsec/what-sbom-and-why-do-you-need-one?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [WhiteHat Security](https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/application-security-has-its-best-ever-chance-for-success/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), and [Zimperium](https://blog.zimperium.com/why-the-software-bill-of-materialssbom-must-extend-to-the-mobile-app-supply-chain/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). And that‚Äôs just to name a few.

Interestingly, DevSec related features are increasingly appearing as partner integrations *(and likely as an eventual native competitive parity offer)* within collaborative code services such as [GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-22-github-advisory-database-now-open-to-community-contributions/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/02/16/a-community-driven-advisory-database/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

These approaches can be helpful in trying to find a needle‚Ä¶ in a fullstack. Right?

So, what about about when the build breaks? Or you just inherited responsibility for a new (to you) codebase that was assembled over a time period longer than your entire career? Or your DevOps and DevSecOps teams are shifting their entire approach to everything in order to embrace an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ethos?

It‚Äôs fun but true story time. My first use of [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/search?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) was a year ago.

It was the umpteenth time to find what I did that broke the builds for my Gatbsy based blog. GitHub, Visual Studio, and diff were not helping me ‚Äì but [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/search?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) let me know it was my lack of attention to detail in edits to package.json, gatsby-config.js, and the working environment where I had failed to run `yarn update @mdx-js-some-really-important-dependency-thing`.

Like the [Jenga blocks analogy](https://www.topofthelyne.co/p/sourcegraph-google-for-code?s=r&utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) from [Top of the Lyne](https://www.topofthelyne.co/p/sourcegraph-google-for-code?s=r&utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), if you‚Äôve ever dealt with SCA or xAST tooling, then you‚Äôll be familiar with the need for knowing how to manage compliance posture and addressing security concerns.

So, if you haven‚Äôt taken a good look at [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/search?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), you should. Beyond the *‚ÄúX for Y‚Äù* clich√© of *‚Äúgoogle search for code‚Äù*, using [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/search?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) is a paradigm shift in approaching and interacting with any existing or new codebase across the lifecycle of both contributors and the code itself.

If [software is eating the world](https://fudge.org/archive/social-telecom-2030/?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), then the world is fast becoming an ever larger and ever more varied collection of code. So identifying the costs of time to productive contribution for a new hire on *sprawling high risk high probability high drama committee consensus likely to break the build global monolithic repository* vs. *discrete de-risked specific modular codebase that empowers smaller more autonomous distributed teams* isn‚Äôt just a metrics driven mindset ‚Äì it‚Äôs sound fiscal policy.

*One smaller thing I liked in my career was a job where each new hire was given charge of updating, improving, and editing the ‚Äúnew hire‚Äù wiki, which was started by the old hands. It included a brief history of the system, glossary, tutorial, reference links, etc. New hires are expected to ask questions and improve/update it as they go along. Pretty darn useful.
