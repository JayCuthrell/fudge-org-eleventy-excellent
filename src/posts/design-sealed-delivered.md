# Getting Informed

Now it's time for reading ðŸ“–, listening ðŸŽ§, and watching ðŸ“º suggestions:

- First, [ðŸ“– VLSI Design and FPGA Implementation of an Number Theoretic Transform for Microsoft SEAL-Embedded Library](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10182260) in which [Stefano Di Matteo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefano-di-matteo-81a245170/), [Matteo Lo Gerfo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089916076), and [Sergio Saponara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergio-saponara-3031431/) show what performance is possible in homomorphic encryption with hardware acceleration.
- Second, [ðŸŽ§ Privacy by Design: The Future of Homomorphic Encryption & Secure Data Analytics](https://hackervalley.com/e/privacy-by-design:-the-future-of-homomorphic-encryption-and-secure-data-analytics/) in which [Ron Eddings](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronaldeddings/) and [Chris Cochran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrishvm/) interview [Derek Wood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drwood/) on practical applications of homomorphic encryption. 
- Third, [ðŸ“º ZAMA TFHE-rs vs IBM HELIB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrg7PO61tZo) in which [Maurizio Martignano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauriziomartignano/) demonstrates applying homomorphic encryption to health data.

## Like a fool, I went and stayed too longðŸŽ¶

Everyone seems to be talking about the application of big data being harnessed with machine learning (M.L.) and artificial intelligence (A.I.) but... does all that big data need to be sitting around unencrypted or potentially in a state that could be extracted?

Probably not. Sounds like a bad news headline waiting to be written, right?

As a result, if you haven't digested Getting Informed, no problem... but it's time to learn a bit more about [*homomorphic encryption*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) using a helpful educational video (2018):

## You got my future in your hands ðŸŽ¶

Some of the data that homomorphic encryption protects might be sensitive -- be it medical or even your recent orders in a retail setting. So, imagine the commercial applications and this might seem like it is up in the air... literally?

Case in point... 

[FAA Authorizes Zipline International, Inc. to Deliver Commercial Packages Using Drones That Fly Beyond Operator's Line of Sight](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-authorizes-zipline-deliver-commercial-packages-beyond-line-sight)

The reference to Salt Lake City was interesting and makes sense if you've seen Zipline Sparrow drone and delivery parachute videos before. However, it was the Bentonville, Arkansas reference that got my attention.

Bentonville is the HQ for Walmart. Zipline is a FAA-certificated Part 135 operator.

So, this is about using drones that fly beyond the operatorâ€™s visual line of sight and data collection that may likely shape future policy decisions by the FAA around Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) services and the Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) program.

But wait... there's more. 

What data does the drone need and for how long does it need to retain that data?

What is the spatial and temporal protection of the data entrusted to a drone?

What if the drone is [augmented with increasing levels of A.I. and autonomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2Ka96oSQ2A)?

So, what will be the next big thing in homomorphic encryption?

Until thenâ€¦ Place your bets!
