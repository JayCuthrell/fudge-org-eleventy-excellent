This week we take a look (again) at GitOps and the limits of Generative AI.

Last week we learned that [the definition of GitOps was fluid](https://fudge.org/archive/gitops-goes-the-world/).

https://fudge.org/archive/gitops-goes-the-world/

Today's inspiration comes from antimetabole[^ antimetabole], chiasmus[^chiasmus], and an attempt to expend ~500 words. Also, I get to use [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com) now that [Google Workspace users can be enabled](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/05/admin-control-for-bard-access.html).

## Get your back up off the wall ðŸŽ¶

Until rhetorical flourish arrives via abundant VC funding and/or OpenGitOps, wordplay is harder than it looks. My best attempts are riffs on the \_slow is smooth and smooth is fast\_ military phrase:

> Incomplete GitOps limits developers' flow and an incomplete GitOps flow limits developers.

or...

> Ruthless removal of annoyance results leads to GitOps and GitOps leads to reducing annoyances ruthlessly.

Sure, not my best, but they capture a baseline of my capability on a Sunday afternoon. Or as the saying goes...

Ploce[^ploce], but no cigar? ðŸ¤“

Now, let's augment my \_feeble\_ human brain with Google Bard to see what it renders.

> Explain GitOps using antimetabole or chiasmus as a rhetorical device.

Result:

\_My completely off the cuff dÃ©jÃ  vu search results theory\_: Google Bard trained on artifacts from [Sweagle](https://web.archive.org/web/20200817172318/https://www.sweagle.com/) around the time [ServiceNow acquired Sweagle back in 2020](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-to-acquire-sweagle.html). More research is needed with access to transparency reporting of Google Bard results.

## Cause I heard all the people sayin ðŸŽ¶

Granted, rhetoric driven definitions might be edge case for a marketing copy team queries. So, let's simplify the prompt to Google Bard.

> Where can I learn more about GitOps?

(\_Note: I freely admit I am not an expert on prompting and I might be "holding it wrong". My comments are in italics after the screenshot.\_)

Result:

- \_Nope. It was a link to [~3 year old podcast and the podcast art](https://open.spotify.com/show/52ZbO0ZuUDrXqV8WyWgHMJ).\_
- \_Nope. It was a link to [(FOSDEM) video recordings](https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/download/tables/fosdem/videoyears.html).\_
- \_Closer. It was a link to [~3 year old reference to a deleted GitHub repository](https://web.archive.org/web/20201211021319/https://github.com/fluxcd/gitops-working-group).\_
- \_Solid listicle advice! But, no links.\_
- \_Solid listicle advice! But, no links.\_

Cosmetically, the results seemed promising until the click through. Again, more research is needed with access to transparency reporting of Google Bard results.

So, what will be the next big thing in GitOps and the limits of Generative AI?

Until thenâ€¦ Place your bets!
