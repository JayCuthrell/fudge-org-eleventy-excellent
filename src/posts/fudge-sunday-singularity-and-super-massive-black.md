 **Getting Informed**

Last week was a big deal for anyone that geeks out on astrophysics. When I sat down to start this issue, I was still thinking about imagery that captured imaginations this past week – a [black hole](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/black-holes?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

Press coverage was a mixed bag but the word “singularity” seemed to have broken free from the seemingly more common association with Ray Kurzweil and dystopian futurist sci-fi fever dream AI. Finally, *singularity* can be freely associated with super massive black holes again!

So, this issue of the newsletter looks back at a timeline where the world *singularity* that was associated with super massive black holes became more commonly used in reference to *“the singularity”* and became part of memes. It appears that the timeline, like the idea of *“the singularity”*, reached exponential human challenges along the way.

Speaking of memes… the “[how it started how it’s going](https://www.fastcompany.com/90570574/how-it-started-vs-how-its-going-has-become-the-all-purpose-meme-of-2020?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)” meme did come to mind as I compiled these links. Still, it’s an interested arc to ponder.

Google Trends is fun. I wondered if there was any impact web search search terms in the results when Singularity University was formed in September 2008. [One spike in Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore/TIMESERIES/1652665200?date=2008-01-01%202022-05-15&hl=en-US&q=the%20singularity%2Cblack%20holes&sni=3&tz=240&utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) made me wonder if people were hearing about Singularity Institute, Singularity University, etc. and that resulted in black hole searches – but no that wasn’t it.

As it turns out, the Google Trends spike was more likely due to the energizing of the Large Hadron Collider. No super massive blackhole was formed and the only singularity was the group Ray Kurzweil was forming that year.
