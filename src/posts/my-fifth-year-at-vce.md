Confession. I’ve had this happen to me.

This post is as much about the past 72 hours as it is about the past 72 months. It is important to keep that timeline in mind.

There are always going to be 20/20 hindsight moments and sometimes there is an epiphany. This post will be lighter on details as has come to be the case with my blog in recent years.

I have some thoughts I share and some thoughts I keep to myself. Blogging is ultimately an ability to have a personal publishing platform. Blogging need not be an exhaustive attempt to somehow upload the entirety of a conscisouness. Blogging can simply be a flat text file containing markdown that is organized to convey a concept, idea, direction, opinion set or merely to mark a moment.

This post is the latter. This post is meant to mark a moment and opinion — mine.

This entry marks off another year at VCE.

*5* years!

The Part Where I Talk About Me
------------------------------

This post is memorable for me on a few key metrics.

First, I’ve gone global again! In my newest new role I’ve been fortunate to work with an ever expanding team. I get to constantly iterate in a variety of focus areas within and across Federation and Federation partners.

Second, I’ve traveled approximately 1 million miles all over the globe according to my trip tracker! It’s not a great story in terms of carbon credits perhaps but I get a lot done and make the most out of each trip. Thank you Las Vegas.

Third, I’ve completed hundreds if not around a thousand customer meetings! Being close to customers is incredibly rewarding and I am grateful and thankful for that constant exposure.

BTW… using GitHub Pages to host this blog has been interesting but hasn’t actually increased my publishing frequency. Long live flat file rendering.

The Part Where I Talk About VCE Since My Last Update
----------------------------------------------------

Luckily, I haven’t stopped tweeting since my last update on all things VCE. So, in the spirit of using what I’ve already tweeted / retweeed / favorited on Twitter, I present a timeline since my 4th year at VCE to present.

Enjoy!

The Part Where I Talk About The Recent News
-------------------------------------------

Again, I think it is important to consider not just the past 72 hours, but the past 72 months. So, in that spirit, I’m going to simply post a few select tweets. (Edit: 41 in total for this post in case you are playing along at home)

The Part Where I Talk About The Industry
----------------------------------------

Recently, 451 Group found that [40% of senior IT professionals are planning on moving moreso towards converged infrastructure](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13020926.htm). Additionally, VCE is seen as a leader in converged infrastructure so it would seem that the industry is still moving in the direction that pulled me to VCE in the first place.

Others would do well to take heed.

Speaking of which… here’s a great example of a 72 months view and perspective:

I’ll only be directing those reading this update to the official tweets and links from the company listed above. As always, everything else is just my opinion and my opinion alone and this post is meant to mark a moment.
