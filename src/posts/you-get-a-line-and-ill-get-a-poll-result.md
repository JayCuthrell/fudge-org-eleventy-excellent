================

You might recall, I put a poll in the newsletter[1](#footnote-1) and on LinkedIn[2](#footnote-2) too. I also summarized the results over on LinkedIn Creator (aka Pulse)[3](#footnote-3) for good measure.

Meanwhile, a recent article from Protocol highlighted the importance cost optimization in the pursuit of AI and machine learning by reminding everyone that cloud is an operating model ‚Äî not a place.[4](#footnote-4) Indeed, some have argued for disciplined repatriation but, as always, please do the math first.[5](#footnote-5)

At the same time, math should govern most suitable placement decisions. Again, the *edge to core to (public) cloud* conversation should be data driven throughout the workload lifecycle and across the workload landscape itself.
