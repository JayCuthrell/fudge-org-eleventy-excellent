[fudge.org](https://fudge.org) has been many things over the years. 

I'm [Jay Cuthrell](https://jaycuthrell.com) and I've blogged on an off again since the late 1990s and decided to go weekly publishing of a newsletter called Fudge Sunday a few years ago. Yes, I publish my newsletter on Sunday. 

The website you are viewing now is the latest version of [fudge.org](https://fudge.org) based on an amazingly opinionated starter called [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/).  

That's all for now. Here's a youtube video to keep you amused.
