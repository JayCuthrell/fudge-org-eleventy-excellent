[fudge.org](https://fudge.org) has been many things over the years. 

I'm [Jay Cuthrell](https://jaycuthrell.com). I've blogged on and off again since the late 1990s. I also publish a weekly newsletter called Fudge Sunday which arrives... usually... on Sunday. ðŸ¤“

The website you are viewing now is the latest version of [fudge.org](https://fudge.org). It is based on an amazingly opinionated starter called [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/).
