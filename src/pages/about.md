[fudge.org](https://fudge.org) has been many things over the years. 

I'm [Jay Cuthrell](https://jaycuthrell.com). I've blogged on and off again since the late 1990s. I also publish a weekly newsletter called Fudge Sunday which arrives... usually... on Sunday. ðŸ¤“

The website you are viewing now is the latest version of [fudge.org](https://fudge.org). It is based on an amazingly opinionated starter called [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) by [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/).  

 <ul class="wrapper grid mt-l-xl" role="list" data-rows="masonry" data-layout="50-50">
    <li class="card flow overflow-hidden">
      <h4>Subscribe to Fudge Sunday</h4>
      <form action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/jaycuthrell" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.fudge.org', 'popupwindow')" class="embeddable-buttondown-form">
